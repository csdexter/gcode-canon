* we are not a G-Code validator, input must be well formed. We will fathom the 
  widest possible extent of G-Code in use in the wild, but we will neither
  check nor fix your spelling.
* not more than 65536 lines per G-Code file
* machine coordinate system is in mm
* only three axes (no A,B,C)
* arc I,J,K are *always* relative to the arc starting point
* machine display/conceptual precision is 10um
* F has integer precision in mm/min
* all display and save/restore of doubles is in %4.2f format
* since this is a mill, we assume we'll never see the E word. If this changes,
  we'll need to change strtod() not to think "<some digits>E<some digits>" is
  scientific notation.
* we now use the seekable stream model but do not parse the whole file at the
  beginning to extract O words which, in effect, means that we can only call
  things we have already seen (and executed). Fix this shit!
* integers must be integers, no G00.0000000 garbage.
* surprisingly, gcode-machine should poll overrides and dynamically apply any
  changes.
