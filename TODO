* move towards treating (X, Y, Z) as an array -- makes plane switching a lot easier
* add rotational axes (A, B, C)
* fix all remaining weird stuff in NOTES (such as being unable to parse G00.000 as G00)
* complete the testing suite
* implement extra math for radius compensation in gcode-math
* implement radius compensation logic in move_machine_queue
* start adding kinematic stuff around move_machine_queue (acceleration planning, contour control etc.)
