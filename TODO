* move towards treating (X, Y, Z) as an array -- makes plane switching a lot easier
* add rotational axes (A, B, C)
* fix all remaining weird stuff in NOTES (such as being unable to parse G00.000 as G00)
* complete the testing suite
* replace calls to move_machine_ in gcode-state with enqueue_move
* implement move_machine_queue() in dumb-pipe mode
* change main loop in gcode-canon to include a call to move_machine_queue
* implement extra math for radius compensation in gcode-math
* move remaining math still in gcode-machine to gcode-math (_adjust_feed and move_machine_arc)
* implement radius compensation logic in move_machine_queue
* start adding kinematic stuff around move_machine_queue (acceleration planning, contour control etc.)
